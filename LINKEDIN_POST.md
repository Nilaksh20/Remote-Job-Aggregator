🚀 Just built a production-grade Job API Aggregator that fetches jobs from 6+ public APIs and normalizes them into one unified stream!

✨ Features:
• Multi-API integration (Remotive, Adzuna, JSearch, Careerjet, The Muse, USAJobs)
• Smart deduplication across sources
• Auto-categorization (Software Engineering, Data Science, AI/ML, Internships)
• Real-time job aggregation
• Clean, modular Flask architecture

🔧 Tech Stack:
• Flask
• Python
• RESTful API integration
• Environment-based configuration

The system automatically:
→ Fetches jobs from multiple sources
→ Normalizes heterogeneous API responses
→ Removes duplicates
→ Categorizes intelligently
→ Sorts by recency

Built with production-grade practices: error handling, type hints, modular design, and comprehensive documentation.

Perfect for job seekers who want to see all opportunities in one place! 🎯
